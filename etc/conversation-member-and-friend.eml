21 hours ago
here's a funny story for you! One time, I decided to bake a cake for my =
friend=E2=80=99s birthday. I wanted it to be perfect, so I followed the =
recipe very carefully. I mixed all the ingredients, put the cake in the =
oven, and waited. When the timer went off, I opened the oven to find =
that the cake had completely overflowed and was dripping down the sides =
of the pan! Turns out, I had accidentally used self-rising flour instead =
of regular flour. The cake rose way too much! We still had a good laugh =
about it, and I managed to salvage enough to put together a makeshift =
birthday cake. My friend loved it, and we ended up eating the =
overflowing bits as a fun snack. It=E2=80=99s a baking mishap I=E2=80=99ll=
 never forget!
