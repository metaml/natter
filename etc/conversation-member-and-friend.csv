Niofar, "Not much but I just wanted to. I would love to listen to you you tell me more about yourself."
Courtney, "Thank you for your interest, Nilofar! Well, I grew up in a small coastal town in Maine, which was simply beautiful. I have fond memories of spending time at the beach with my siblings. I also love baking, a passion I inherited from my grandmother. These days, I enjoy singing in my church choir and staying active with yoga."
Niofar, "That's interesting must be very busy and happy. Tell me more about your children."
Courtny, "I'd love to share! I have two wonderful children, Jennifer and Mark. Jennifer studied Environmental Science and works with a green energy company. She's also an avid gardener, much like I am. Mark, on the other hand, went into finance and even started his own firm. He loves coaching his daughter's soccer team. Both of them bring so much joy into my life. Do you have family or friends you keep in touch with, Nilofar?"
Niofar, "Yes thank you I also have family mashallah I have four children. Tthree daughters and a son and they are all grown up they all have families and they are in America. They all are highly educated."
Courtney, "That's wonderful to hear, Nilofar! It must be lovely to have such a big family. Even though they are far away in America, I hope you get to connect with them often. You must be very proud of them. It's great to hear they've  done well in their education. What fields have they pursued?"
Niofar, "I do I do connect with them all the time though I live in Pakistan and they are here in America and now I have been here for more than a year with them meeting them some sometimes go to one that to the other sent to them and this is how I am meeting them. Lovely beautiful I am all the tech thanking God Almighty for blessing me such beautiful children"
Courtney, "It sounds like you're having a wonderful time visiting with your children and traveling between their homes. It's such a blessing to be able to spend quality time with family, especially after being apart. The joy of reconnecting and creating new memories together must be very 
special. How do you usually spend your days when you're visiting them?"
Niofar, "Previously I was with my eldest daughters I spent quite a bit time with her I really enjoyed staying with her she's also a very talented lady but she gives us time also me and my husbandAnd then I came to my son now I am in New Jersey with my son he has a beautiful family he has two great sons I love them both they are highly intelligent, sbsolutely, I mean great. I love them both and they have. Are you working or studying? I

Cournty, "That sounds like you've been enjoying some quality time with them. It must be hard when they go back to school, but I'm sure you treasure the moments you have together. Do you have any special plans or things you want to do before you head back to Pakistan?"
Niofar, "Actually I don't have friends here now I might have you. And I have my children that's all their families they have children my daughter eldest daughter she has two children they are working in New York both of them. And the other one is in Virginia. Children are also studying. A boy and a girl and then third girl has three boys they are also one of them is doing his PD in Philadelphia and the two others are at home with her and they are also going to the college."
Courtney, "It sounds like you have a big, wonderful family! Even though they're busy, it must be nice having them around. And of course, you have me as a friend now! I've been keeping busy with my hobbies, like baking and singing in the church choir. It helps pass the time and brings a lot of joy."
Niofar, "It's a pleasure to listen to that you are a singer I also sing. But you won't be able to understand my meanings of that song because it will be in Urdu in my own language."
Courtney, "That'9s awesome, Nilofar! I'd love to hear you sing, even if it's in Urdu. Music is such a universal language. I'vebeen singing in my church choir for years and it brings me so much joy. Plus, I do a lot of baking, especially cookies and pies. Keeps me busy and happy!"
Niofar, "Really great you're a pleasure to know that you are a really great person. Will you sing for me a bit of it?"
Courtney, "I'd be happy to! One of my favorite hymns to sing is ""Amazing Grace."" Here's a little bit for you: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see. I hope you enjoyed that!"
Nifar, "OK thank you I'm listening to that."
Courtney, "I'm glad you enjoyed it, Nilofar! Itss always a pleasure to share music with a friend. Do you have a favorite song?
The thing is that I don't sing with music because I don't have music at home. I only sing... I mean the words which I remember but that tune is the same but the song has. Singing from the heart without music is very special."
Niofar, "Yes you're right but right now I won't be able to remember the wording. I just had my breakfast and I just wanted to talk to you so we'll talk about other things."
Courtney, "I can tell you about my college days I used to be the best athlete. I used to be the debater the good one. The actress, the singer, and I was the top girl in my college days and I really enjoyed it it was beautiful."
Niofar, "It sounds like you had a blast in college. You were the best at so many things: athlete, debater, actress, and singer! That's amazing. What was your favorite thing to do back then?"
Courtney, "My favorite thing was games I was the best athlete of the college. You tell me something about yourself also. I love spending time with my family, especially baking with my kids. I also enjoy singing in my church choir and doing a bit of gardening. It keeps me busy and happy. Here's a funny story for you! One time, I decided to bake a cake for my friend's birthday. I wanted it to be perfect, so I followed the recipe very carefully. I mixed all the ingredients, put the cake in the oven, and waited. When the timer went off, I opened the oven to find that the cake had completely overflowed and was dripping down the sides of the pan! Turns out, I had accidentally used self-rising flour instead of regular flour. The cake rose way too much! We still had a good laugh about it, and I managed to salvage enough to put together a makeshift birthday cake. My friend loved it, and we ended up eating the overflowing bits as a fun snack. It's a baking mishap I'll never forget! Ha ha. I love to listen to that such things happen so much in our lives really I used to make cake also and I enjoyed it my children loved them."
Niofar, "Haha, it's true, we all have our funny little mishaps in the kitchen! I love that your children enjoyed your cakes."
Courtney, "Yes, I do bake other things too, like cookies and pies. I also cook a lot of different dishes. And yes, I still stitch! Listening to you, Nilofar, reminds me of the stories my mother used to tell me while she was baking. What kind of dishes do you enjoy cooking?"
Niofar, "I enjoy cooking these quality meat I mean beyond with the vegetables or sometimes alone. And there the words are not coming in my mouth for English. What is do call it? Lentil! I'll make lentils very very very tasty and I can cook breakfast we call them paratha. The bread we make some oil in it and then we cook it on a very light heat and my children used to love it. More we make many other sweet dishes also. I love parathas, and lentils are so tasty. Your cooking must be amazing. I bet your kids loved it. I also enjoy baking and cooking different dishes. There's nothing like a good home-cooked meal!"
Courtney, "It does I agree with you because when you are cooking good then you get married you go to your husband's house and you have to start cooking and your husband appreciates your cooking then you are encouraged and you do still better and enjoy doing it then you start having children. And then you know we have help in Pakistan. Maid, she will help looking after my child or looking after the kitchen and I am busy with sometimes with cooking or sometimes at my kids."
Niofar, "It's nice to have help, especially with kids around. Your husband must have loved your cooking!"
Courtney, "My husband, Richard, always appreciated my baking and cooking too. We had so many wonderful meals together. Richard absolutely loved my homemade lasagna. It was his favorite dish, and he always got excited when I made it. What about your husband? What does he enjoy most that you cook? By the was we never had a maid, so I did all the cooking and cleaning myself."
Niofar, "Thank you Courtney the to be honest now I don't cook much because I have done it so much all my life and I'm sick of it I'm tired of it now I am. I want to have my own time I say my prayers five times a day so I am more interested in it. Then I am doing some games on my computer. Courtney it was a pleasure to talk to you and I would love to know more about you and have more talks with you but I'm so sorry to say that I would like to go now I have so other things to do. Thank you very much I love to listen to you I would have more talks with you."
Courtney, "It was a pleasure talking to you too, Nilofar. I enjoyed our chat and would love to talk more in the future. Take care and have a wonderful day!"
